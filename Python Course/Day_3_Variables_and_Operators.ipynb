        "\n",
        "In Python, variable names must adhere to specific rules and conventions to ensure clarity, readability, and consistency in code. Adhering to these rules and conventions is essential for writing maintainable and understandable Python code.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Rules for Naming Variables:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Valid Characters: Variable names can contain letters (both lowercase and uppercase), digits, and underscores (_). They must start with a letter or an underscore but cannot start with a digit.\n",
        "2. Case Sensitivity: Python is case-sensitive, meaning uppercase and lowercase letters are treated differently. For example, age, Age, and AGE are considered distinct variable names.\n",
        "3. Reserved Words: Avoid using Python's reserved words (keywords) as variable names, as they have special meanings in Python. Examples of reserved words include if, else, for, while, True, False, None, etc.\n",
        "4. Length: Variable names can be of any length, but it's recommended to use meaningful and descriptive names that are not excessively long.\n",
        "5. Whitespace: Variable names cannot contain spaces or special characters other than underscores. Use underscores to separate words in variable names for improved readability (snake_case convention).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conventions for Naming Variables:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Descriptive Names: Use descriptive and meaningful names that reflect the purpose or content of the variable. Avoid cryptic or abbreviated names that may be unclear to others.\n",
        "2. CamelCase vs. snake_case: Python developers commonly use two naming conventions: CamelCase and snake_case.\n",
        "* CamelCase: Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one, without using spaces or underscores. Example: camelCaseVariable.\n",
        "* snake_case: Use all lowercase letters with underscores (_) between words. Example: snake_case_variable.\n",
        "3. Consistency: Maintain consistency in naming conventions throughout your codebase. Choose one naming convention (e.g., snake_case) and stick to it consistently for all variable names.\n",
        "4. Meaningful Prefixes/Suffixes: Consider using prefixes or suffixes to indicate the type or purpose of variables. For example, num_students, is_active, total_count, etc.\n",
