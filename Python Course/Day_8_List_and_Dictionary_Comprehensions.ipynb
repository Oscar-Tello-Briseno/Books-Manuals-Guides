        "\n",
        "Comprehensions in Python provide a concise syntax for creating lists, dictionaries, and sets based on existing iterables such as lists, tuples, or ranges. They allow you to generate data structures in a single line of code, making your code more readable and expressive.\n",

        "* Concise Syntax: Comprehensions allow you to express complex operations in a compact and readable manner, reducing the amount of code you need to write.\n",
        "* Efficiency: Comprehensions are often more efficient than traditional looping constructs because they are optimized at the CPython level.\n",
