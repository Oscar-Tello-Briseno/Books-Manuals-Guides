It allows programmers to direct the flow of execution based on conditions, loops, and function calls. Control flow is essential for defining the logic and behavior of a program, enabling it to respond dynamically to different situations.\n",

        "\n",
        "Control flow determines the sequence in which statements are executed within a program. It allows developers to control the execution path based on specific conditions or criteria. Control flow constructs, such as conditional statements (if, else, elif), loops (for, while), and function calls, enable programmers to implement decision-making logic, iteration, and modularization in their code.\n",
